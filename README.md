Minimal Working Example for RediStreaming
=========================================

This repository contains the application setup for a minimal working example of a word counting streaming module using [RediStreaming](https://github.com/ChrisG55/RediStreaming), [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis), and [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB).

This application setup was employed in an use case to measure the energy consumption of hardware exploiting Intel SGX and AMD SEV trusted execution environments. Further details can be found in the published [paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2018.00024).
